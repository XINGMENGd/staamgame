Times is committed to protecting your privacy. Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required. We want you to understand what information we collect, what we don't collect, and how we collect, use, and store information. We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or installed applications. We designed our systems not to have sensitive data about you; even when compelled, we cannot provide data that we do not possess.
This Privacy Policy describes how TIMES TECHNOLOGY LIMITED and its affiliates ("Times," "we," "our" or "us") collect, use, and share information in connection with your use of our websites, services, and applications (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") does not apply to information you may process when using our Services.
1. (USER-CONTROLLED OPTION): PERSONAL INFORMATION
Times are not available for the information related to the personal information of users, including but not limited to names (subscriber names, user names and screen names), addresses (including mailing addresses, residential address, business addresses) and telephones, unless the data you provide depending on the context of your interactions with us and the choices you make, including your privacy settings, and the products and features you use for the purpose of administering your subscription and for the purpose to enjoy our Services. Except for the limited exceptions, we don't automatically collect any Personal Information from you.
When you open the APP seeking for our Services, the APP assigns a unique identifier to you for the Service (such unique identifier just binds up with your device identification code, but does not tie to any other personal information of users). When you use the Services, we will check your account information through this unique identifier to determine the level of service you have signed up for before providing Services.
If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.
Times uses your email address (if any depending on your choice) for the following reasons:
To communicate with you about your services or respond to your communications.
To send you updates and announcements.
To send marketing information, such as Times offers, surveys, invitations, and content about other matters in connection with Times ("Marketing emails"). You may choose to not receive Marketing emails by following the opt-out procedure described in these emails.
Times uses your personal information only for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, and we don't sell your personal information to third parties without your prior consent.

We do not know the set of original IP addresses of a user's device or the temporarily assigned network addresses.

5. JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW
Keeping your information private is our core mission. In service of this mission, Times's registered place of business is in Singapore, where has integrated data protection legislation.
There are no special data retention laws and no guidance pertaining to e-discovery or disclosure to foreign law enforcement agencies in Singapore. The disclosure of personal data may follow this Privacy Policy.
Required by any foreign law enforcement agencies, Times turns over protected user information only upon receipt of a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant, which shall be served effectively under the Rules of Court of Singapore. More specifically, we think the subpoena, court order or search warrant may lose its coercive effect when it crosses its boundary. It only regains coercive effect on the other side of the line either through a domestication action (in the other state's courts) or under the authority of a statute. Additionally, we will notify affected users about any requests for their account information, unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order. Should we receive a valid served legal order, it is important to note that Times does not collect any IP addresses, browsing history, traffic data, or DNS queries that could be used to identify any specific user.
6. DATA RETENTION
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
We keep records of any correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit to us, along with our response. Depending on how you contact us, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us. Having full correspondence records enables us to provide the best possible customer support experience.
We use emails for support correspondence: support@sdzdtech.com.
When you correspond with us using these emails, your correspondence records, including your name and email address, are stored in their systems
7. SECURITY MEASURES
Times is committed to protecting your information. We use best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of information. Access to user information is restricted to staff who require such access to perform their job functions.
While we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data security measures in the world can offer 100% protection.
Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices. None of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of services. If any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative options.
Even if a government were to physically seize one of our servers and manage to break its disk encryption, there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular event, website, or behavior.
8. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
You may access other third-party services while using the services, for example by clicking on links to those third-party services from within the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third-party services, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies.
9. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
We feel under a particular obligation to protect information obtained from young children. We would strongly urge parents to instruct their children never to disclose their real name, their address or their telephone number while they are on-line without prior permission. Times does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16, and children under 16 years old are prohibited from using our services. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, you can alert us at support@sdzdtech.com.
10. ACCESS
When you become one of our users for the Services, you may access certain information associated with you by emailing support@sdzdtech.com. If you decide not to use our Services any more, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public.
To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or removing your information. The information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us according to backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could: inhibit our ability to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit our ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to us or a third party.
11. GDPR
Times is committed to user privacy globally, and personal information under users' control and minimal collection of data are our existing practices. According to the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU), we collect and process the data in a specific manner of users in EU outlined in this Privacy Policy on one of the following bases, depending on the circumstances:
